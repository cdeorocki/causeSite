								<h3>Add Your Signature</h3>
									<p style="line-height:200%;"> There are several petitions circulating the Internet that ask the president, and our government, to tackle Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) head on, and to enforce the legally regulated use of insecticides. Petitions help to show the judicial system, that the population cares and unanimously wants issues like CCD to be resolved. Signing your name shows that you support the end of systemic pesticides, the prevention of CCD and the practice of sustainable farming. Sign any of the petitions you see on the web or feel free to sign ours! </p>

								<h3>Everyday Tips</h3>
									<!-- <p>There are several personal choices you can make, everyday, to help contribute to a healthier environment and therefore, a healthy bee population.</p>  -->
									<p>a) Stop buying commercial pesticides, herbicides and fertilizers. These products are both dangerous to the bees, but also to you and your family. By buying these products you are supporting an industry that is truly killing the honeybee population. Use alternative, natural solutions instead.</p> 
									<p>b) Do buy honey and beeswax products regularly, and from a local source. This supports small-farm based beekeepers that tend to be more invested in the health of their bees. This can not be said of most large scale honey corporations. This support drives local beekeeper trade, as well as, more sustainable farming practices.</p>
									<p>c) Do allow dandelions and clover to grow in your yard. These flowers take absolutely no effort, on your part, to grow and are an excellent form of nourishment and pollen for honeybees to make honey and to feed their young.</p>

								<h3>Spread Awareness</h3>
									<p style="line-height:200%;">Getting the word out is half the battle. Many people donâ€™t even know what Colony Collapse Disorder is, or fail to recognize how severe its effects would be on our everyday lives. Social platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest reach a global audience quickly. Social media websites can be used as a tool to promote healthier farming practices or teach about the dangers of neonicotinoids. Sharing articles, posting pictures or typing up personal sentiments on websites like these, can spread awareness and provoke action: positive change. </p>
